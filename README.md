# API client 

A ReactJs app created via Vite, this React app will help you to handle many http requests and methods.
I used my API that i've built previously: `https://backendserver-h5d1.onrender.com/api/v1/food`,
then i used the useReducer with the new feature History and app components

### Running the app:
* npm run dev

### Screenshotes
