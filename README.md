# API client 

A ReactJs app created via Vite, this React app will help you to handle many http requests and methods.
I used my API that i've built previously: `https://auth-api-ylcl.onrender.com/api/v1/food`,
then i used the useReducer with the new feature History and app components


### Running the app:
* npm run dev
